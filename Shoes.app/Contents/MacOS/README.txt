# About Shoes

Shoes is the best little DSL for cross-platform GUI programming there is. It feels like real Ruby, rather than just another C++ library wrapper. If Gtk or wxWidgets is Rails, Shoes is Sinatra.

# Let me tell you a story about Shoes

  Way way back in the day, there was a guy named \_why. He created a project known as [Hackety Hack](http://hackety-hack.com) to teach programming to everyone. In order to reach all corners of the earth, \_why decided to make Hackety Hack work on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. This was a lot of work, and so \_why decided to share his toolkit with the world. Thus, Shoes was born.

Everybody loved Shoes. Many apps were made, and put into [The Shoebox](http://the-shoebox.org/). But, one day, \_why left. In his memory, Team Shoes assembled, and carried on making Shoes. They released Shoes 3 in late summer 2010.

# So what do these Shoes look like?

Here's a little Shoes app. It's a stopwatch!

    Shoes.app :height => 150, :width => 250 do
      background rgb(240, 250, 208)
      stack :margin => 10 do
        button "Start" do
          @time = Time.now
          @label.replace "Stop watch started at #@time"
        end
        button "Stop" do
          @label.replace "Stopped, ", strong("#{Time.now - @time}"), " seconds elapsed."
        end
        @label = para "Press ", strong("start"), " to begin timing."
      end
    end

Here's what it looks like:

Pretty simple! For more samples, the manual, and a free book, check out [the Shoes website](http://shoesrb.com/).

# Using Shoes

If you'd like to use Shoes to develop some apps... awesome! It's super easy: Just go to the [downloads page on the Shoes website](http://shoesrb.com/downloads) and download a copy of Shoes for your platform. Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux supported!

After you install Shoes, run it! You'll get a window like this:

![shoes main window](https://github.com/shoes/shoes/raw/develop/static/shoes_main_window.png)

You can then open any .rb file with Shoes code inside by choosing "Open an App." It'll open it up and run it, right away.

Once you're happy with your app, you can choose "Package an App" to wrap up your app as a .exe, .app, or a .run. Then you can share it with someone without a pair of Shoes to call their own.

# Making your own Shoes

You can make your own pair of Shoes with a little bit of elbow grease. Since there are different instructions on each platform, we've got a page up on the [Shoes development wiki](http://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki) about it. It's [right here](https://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki/Building-Shoes).
